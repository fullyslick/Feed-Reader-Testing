# Project Overview

This is my submission for [Udacity's Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001). The project is a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. There are also test suits included, using [Jasmine.js](https://jasmine.github.io/). The required tests for the project (RSS Feed testing, RSS Feed properties, menu default state, and menu hiding/showing) are all provided and are comprehensive enough to adequately test the functionality. The tests are independent of one another. All required tests for the project pass.

## How To Use

- Download or clone this repository.
- If you choose to download, extract the `zip` file.
- In the folder of the project you will find an `index.html` file. Load this file in your favorite browser.
- You should see the **Feed Reader App** and at the bottom of the page - the **Jasmine Tests**.
- Click on a test or a suit of tests.
- If the test or suit of test have passed successfully, there should be `0 failures` message on a green background, as well as the number of tests that you have run. All tests should pass, so you will not encounter errors.
- To check the code of the tests navigate to `jasmine/spec/feedreader.js`. Most of the tests are highly related to `js/app.js` file.
